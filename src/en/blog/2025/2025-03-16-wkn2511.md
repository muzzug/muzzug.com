Third week of sick leave behind me…

On Monday, I did a round of doctors — first a check-up with the general practitioner and then one of the pre-op tests. Running between doctors is exhausting.

I can't say I feel much better. I'm finding that I'm starting to get slight anxiety at times when I'm doing something, and it's not going quite to my liking. 😒 I have another check-up tomorrow, so I'll try to discuss it with my doctor.

## Working on

I finished the course of [making 3D games in Godot](https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/godot-complete-3d). It's great and I can only recommend it.

After a long time, I started to learn Blender. Yeah, I'm combining it a little with the Godot course with the goal of getting into a little 3D project that started in my head…

Other than that, I managed to check out automation for my brother during the week. I managed to do one he needed for a friend, and he was happy with the result. I'm happy! 👍

## Reading

- Terry Pratchett: The Light Fantastic
- Jesse Schell: The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses (3rd Edition)

## Listening

- I'm still on the wave of 80s British punk rock. Cool
- I gave a chance to audiobooks and started listening to “Take a Deep Breath” by Elissa Epel on my walks - a book about how to get rid of chronic stress. Maybe it will help me calm down a bit.

## Playing

- Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. I got the urge to play something, and this has been waiting for me for quite a while. 🙂

## Watching
During this week, we watched:
- [The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher%3A_Sirens_of_the_Deep). Tina's been talking about it for a few days now, and I have to admit, it's not bad at all. I don't really like anime, but this was good. And it was from the world of The Witcher, so that's fine.
- [Vikings: Valhalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings%3A_Valhalla), Season 3. 
- We started watching [Star Wars: The Bad Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Bad_Batch)

## Fitness and lifestyle

Honestly, this week has been pretty uneventful.

The gym's fine. I'm still struggling with 60 kg on the bench press, but it'll do. But everything else was just about a bust.

I only went for a walk on Wednesday (while listening to an audiobook). I've slept pretty poorly since Thursday (in fact, I practically didn't sleep on Friday night, full moon be damned), so I've taken a more restful approach to the rest of the week. And also because it got cold outside and discouraged me. 😅 But I do miss walking a bit… Hopefully, next week will go better.

- Wednesday's walk — 7.06 km, 01:51:05, pace 3.8 km/h
