This week included a day off in the form of Easter Monday. Not that it would have made any difference to me on sick leave… 

I spent most of my time reading or editing automation for my brother.

On Thursday, my dad came to visit us, so we went for a late lunch (at 3 pm) and sat and chatted for a while. It was fine, though quite short.

On Friday I finally got my starter set with Arduino and books. I immediately started testing and playing with it and - why didn't I start sooner?! I'm enjoying it, a lot. Even though I'm just blinking LEDs and playing with text on a 16x2 display for now, but I'm having fun. I have minor reservations about the kit itself, but I'll probably write a separate article on that sometime. 

On Sunday, a friend came to visit us. If I remember correctly, I hadn't seen her in a little over a year and a half? I think the last time was at my wedding party, but I could be wrong…

## Reading

- Jesse Schell: The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses (3rd Edition)
- Tracy Fullerton: Game Design Workshop
- Martin Malý: Hradla, volty, jednočipy (🇨🇿)

## Watching

- while waiting for new episodes of Star Wars: Andor we watched Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett
- we started watching What We Do in the Shadows

## Listening

- I finally finished listening to the audiobook "The Stress Prescription: Seven Days to More Joy and Ease" by Elissa Epel
- I started listening to the podcast "Dlouhé devatenácté" (🇨🇿) about events that took place in the 19th century. Quite interesting. 🙂

## Fitness and lifestyle

I started going for walks again! I've done a total of five this week. Still about the same route around Svitava to Obřany, turn around at the bridge, and hurrah back. 🙂

- 7,26 km, 01:37:45, 4,5 km/h
- 7,43 km, 01:45:19, 4,2 km/h
- 7,41 km, 01:41:48, 4,4 km/h
- 7,19 km, 01:37:47, 4,4 km/h
- 7,24 km, 01:36:41, 4,5 km/h

I'm not ready for the gym or riding the exercise bike yet, but it's coming!

## What caught my eye (or mind)

Of course, I use Arduino IDE to play with Arduino. And I'm pretty annoyed! 😅

Like - it works, but code autocompletion and stuff like that is not the most optimal. Plus, it bothers me that every sketch opens in a new window (and the old one stays open). So I started looking for something "better".

After a bit of searching, I found [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org), which is an add-on to VS Code. The minor problem is that I'm using Codium, and PlatformIO can't be installed there completely. I mean - I finally managed to do it, but it doesn't work as it should. It means loading it in via a .vsix file, and you also need to have the MS C/C++ add-on, which is not available for Codium. And without it PlatformIO doesn't work. 😔 I managed that too, but:

- I'm annoyed that I keep getting a message that the C/C++ add-on can only be used with VS Code and that this violates the license
- IntelliSense doesn't work with it in Codium.

And so I started looking into what to do next.

PlatformIO also works with other editors like Vim or Emacs. This led me to the fact that I've been seeing people using [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/) quite a lot lately, and I've thinking about it before…

Well, it looks like I'm going to give Doom Emacs a try. So far I've installed it and I'm discovering what it actually does and how it works.

I don't know if it's me not knowing how to search or if there's no such thing, but I haven't found any tutorial for complete newbies, so it's a bit more challenging, but never mind. I'll manage it.

And I'm considering writing some articles about it if there's interest. Would you be interested?
