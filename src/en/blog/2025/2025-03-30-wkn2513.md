Another week is behind us. Sick leave continues and surgery is coming up, so I'veÂ been going to the doctors aÂ lot this week.

It started on Monday with aÂ pre-op appointment with the doctor. It went great, everything'sÂ fine. The only little thing that screwed it up aÂ little was that when they did my labs last Thursday, the nurse accidentally didn'tÂ send all the request papers, so some results weren'tÂ included. ğŸ˜… Except that IÂ needed them now on Thursday for the anaesthesiology consultation, so IÂ repeated the samples on Tuesday.

Thursday'sÂ anaesthesiology went well too. We agreed on what to do, IÂ signed the consent formâ€¦ Now IÂ just have to look forward to the surgery. And the main positive â€“ IÂ don'tÂ have to shave my beard! Yay! ğŸ¥³

## Working on

In my spare time, IÂ continue to learn automation â€“ my brother came up with aÂ few more ideas of what he'dÂ like to automate, so I'mÂ trying it out.

And I'veÂ also made an automation for posting from blog posts to Mastodon. No AI, IÂ write all the text for it myself, but then IÂ don'tÂ have to think about sending it â€“ the robot grabs it from the RSS feed and sends it to Mastodon.

And in my even more spare moments, I'veÂ started taking the [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course. 

## Reading

- Jesse Schell: The Art of Game Design: AÂ Book of Lenses (3rd Edition)
- Godot Engine 4.4.1 documentation (I had to actually read it once)

## Watching

We finished watching The Bad Batch and TÃ½na wanted to watch Star Wars: Rebels. So now we're watching it.

## Fitness and lifestyle

Like IÂ said, I'veÂ mostly been visiting doctors this week. It'sÂ quite exhausting, so IÂ didn'tÂ really feel like doing any major activities. So, just one walk this week:

- 7.51Â km, 01:39:55, 4.5Â km/h

And in the gym IÂ managed to get up to 80Â kg on the barbell squat! The bench press still at 60Â kg and IÂ can'tÂ go any higher. And worse â€“ now I'mÂ going to have aÂ few weeks without exercising, so I'mÂ curious what that will doÂ with me.
