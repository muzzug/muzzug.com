Another "two-week recap" because IÂ didn'tÂ feel like writing anything for aÂ long time. ğŸ˜… I'll summarize it all together.

After all, last week was more about resting after Masters of Rock, and IÂ didn'tÂ doÂ much else.

The main event of the week took place on Wednesday â€“ IÂ started English lessons [with Baru](https://www.mluvimnabaru.cz). IÂ need to improve my speaking skills, which IÂ find challenging, so IÂ took advantage of aÂ recommendation and signed up for her lessons. So far, I'mÂ satisfied. We'veÂ already had two lessons, and IÂ never thought I'dÂ be able to speak English for 50Â minutes straight. It wilw work. We'veÂ put together aÂ long-term and short-term plan, and I'mÂ curious to see how I'll manage to stick to it. So far, I'mÂ happy with Baru and can only recommend her.

On Wednesday after work, IÂ discovered at home that the SSD in my home server, which IÂ had built on RPi, died. Unfortunately, IÂ had no way of testing it â€“ IÂ didn'tÂ have an external enclosure for M.2 drives. So, IÂ had no choice but to buy one and continue testing the drive the next day.

It turned out as IÂ expected, the disk didn'tÂ work in other PCs either, so IÂ sent it back that same day. By the way, they managed to process my warranty claim and I'veÂ had aÂ new one at home since Friday. The whole warranty claim process took 7 days. Wow!

Last weekend, TÃ½na was visiting her family, and IÂ spent it very unproductivelyâ€”watching YouTube videos about [HEMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_European_martial_arts). After FantastickÃ¡ Ostrava, photos and videos from the tournament there started popping up, followed by more, and eventually IÂ was tempted to give it aÂ try. So on Tuesday evening, IÂ went to aÂ training session of the fencing group [BrnÄ›nÅ¡tÃ­ fechteÅ™i](https://fechteri.cz) to check it out.

It was great, and IÂ see it as aÂ new sport that IÂ will start doing. IÂ don'tÂ know yet whether it will be during the summer or in September, but we'll see. ğŸ™‚ The only minor problem IÂ see is that training sessions are on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so just like my gym sessionsâ€¦ ğŸ˜…

And while I'mÂ on the subject of the gym â€“ IÂ completed my workouts on Tuesday and Thursday, plus IÂ did an extra one on Sunday.

Over the weekend, we went to visit Dad in BudÄ›jovice and took aÂ trip to Krumlov. We had tickets to see The Hound of the Baskervilles at the [Revolving Theater](https://www.otacivehlediste.cz/en). It was aÂ very entertaining play, IÂ highly recommend it. In fact, the entire South Bohemian Theater is great and we love going there. ğŸ™‚

Otherwise, on the way to BudÄ›jovice, my brother and IÂ managed to discuss the latest news about automation, go over individual tasks and what needs to be done, so IÂ have an updated work plan again. Now IÂ just have to doÂ itâ€¦ ğŸ˜…
