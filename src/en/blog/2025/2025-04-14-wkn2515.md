This week has been very relaxing after the surgery.

The healing scar has started to hurt and it is restrictive. It's not up to walking yet. 😔 But I took the rest honestly - I turned off all the alarms and let my body determine when it got enough sleep and such. Well, I'm not looking forward to starting to put it back to “normal” - not once have I woken up on my own before 10 😅

We'll see how it goes.

## Working on
I'm continuing with the CS50 - I've had another week, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

I've been playing around with desktop Linux a bit - I installed Fedora 41 on an older laptop and tried to see how it works. After my experience with macOS, it's not such a problem, but I'm a bit limited by the fact that it's really a regular office laptop, so I won't try anything more advanced (like modeling in Blender). Maybe in time I'll try to install it on the desktop and see how it goes. 🙂

On Friday started a new round of [Godot Wild Jam](https://godotwildjam.com). The night before, I had a dream about a game I made for the jam, so I figured I'd give it a try. I mean - the theme is entirely different from what I dreamed about, so I'm doing something completely different, but never mind.

What bothers me a bit is that I'm really slow. But on the other hand, I'm learning quite well by doing it - I spend a lot of time looking down how things work in Godot and how to use them. I'm taking many notes and I think I'll try to make my own documentation out of them…

## Thinking about
In the book Game design workshop, one of the tasks is to keep a game diary - to write down what games I've played, to analyze the mechanics and so on. I'm thinking of doing it here on the blog, but I'm not sure about the form yet. I'll let it settle in my head a bit. I'm curious to see what comes of it. 🙂
