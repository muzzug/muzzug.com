A week passed like water… And after it another one… And meanwhile, I didn't manage to write another Weekly Notes. I mean, I just didn't feel like it. 😅 But whatever. So here we are again after a long time with a double part!

In both weeks Týna was at a music festivals, so I was at home with the cat during the weekends (and a couple of working days).

On the Wednesday before last, we had one of the last DCC sessions. We'll be taking a break for the summer ( 😒 ) and starting in September we'll be starting a new campaign – going to Forgotten Realms. The rules will probably be slightly modified Old-School Essentials (so B/X DnD).

I've also started riding my scooter more. I've ridden to and from work a few times (in evenings) and everything is fine. I also added a few more routes (to the nearest gas station, to the gym) and am generally getting comfortable with the scooter. Now I just need to figure out where to park at work, and hooray to ride!

## Working on
I'm still doing the CS50 course.

I've been looking at some new automations my brother came up with, but not much has come of it yet.

I've started playing around with the Raspberry Pi. I got an RPi 5 with 8 GB of RAM and started building a home server to play on. It took me part of the weekend, but I got everything I wanted so far. And functional!

The other, much bigger part of the weekend was spent playing with Linux. I've thrown it on the laptop and the desktop, and I am trying it out. My main machine remains a MacBook Pro, but one has to keep discovering things, right? And I have a couple of reasons for that, which I'll probably write a separate article about…


## Reading
I went back to reading Tracy Fullerton's Game Design Workshop.

## Fitness and lifestyle
In the gym, we have already started our new training plan.

Tuesdays are easier, less weight and more movement (although there is some lifting in the form of military press). Thursdays, on the other hand, are a little hell.

After the initial warm up we go straight into the “iron triathlon” as the coach called it – dead lift, bench press and barbell squat. 4x8 reps of each. 😅 So far we've tuned the starting weight, but even that gave me quite a hard time. But I like it!

On last Sunday, I had one more workout – I've got a bunch of credits for workouts I've cancelled during the time I've been going, and it's time to start using them.
