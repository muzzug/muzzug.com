On Monday we went to teambuilding in Polička. Such a classic - slight alcohol intoxication, playing games, chatting with colleagues...

On Tuesday we had a treasure hunt around Polička as a teambuilding activity. Our team finished 3rd out of 4. Success! We ended the evening with some barbecue, roasting some sausages, finishing the keg, and so on. All in all it was fine, although the second evening I was a bit over-socialized...

But that was nothing compared to the rest of the week!

On Thursday the conference [Game Access 2025](https://game-access.com/conference/) started, or rather a warm-up party in the Harry brewery in the center of Brno. I didn't really want to go there because of the rain, but I finally convinced myself to go. It was good - I met some friends with whom we chatted, had a few beers, and by midnight I was home.

Friday and Saturday were full of talks. I can't wait to go through my notes and sort of remind myself.🙂

On Friday night, Ronne, which volunteered at Game Access on Saturday, joined me, and we went to the main party of the event, which was at Špilberk. Just like Thursday, we had a few beers, some food, chatted with friends, and listened to the [Sukuba Ensemble](https://sukubaensemble.cz) concert.

Saturday's afterparty was at the Enter club near the Velodrom in Brno. It was also very nice - I met some new people, and despite the fact that we were driven out by the volume of the bands playing, we had a great time. I don't even know when the last time I sat with a beer on the broken steps behind the pub, overlooking the garbage cans... 😅 But I'm really happy.

On Sunday, as expected, I slept and rested. It's been a really exhausting week... 🙂

## Watching
On Sunday, we started watching Star Wars: Ahsoka.

## Fitness and lifestyle
I skipped Tuesday's workout because of team building, but I did go before the warm-up party on Thursday. The pleasant surprise was that I had already prepared a new plan. 3 routines in total, 2 standard ones for Tuesday/Thursday, and an additional one for the extra workouts. I tried the additional one right away, and I'm happy! 

## What caught my eye
There are three games at Game Access that stood to me out:

- [Mini Meowcraft](https://www.minimeowcraft.com)! Warcraft with cats? I'm in! 😻
- Student game [Icaropolis](https://ddaniecheque.itch.io/icaropolis)
- Hussite-era RTS [Songs of the Chalice](https://visiongame.cz/hra/kalich/)
