I enjoyed the shortened work week with a full return to work – back to the office nicely.

On Monday, my manager and I discussed what was going on, and what "restrictions" I have, and then I jumped into absorbing the news that had happened in the two months I was home.

Luckily, it only took 3 days because Thursday was a holiday again. Combined with the planned leave on Friday, it made a nice extra long weekend. 

We'd had a trip to the Jeseníky mountains planned there for a while with my mom, my brother, and his girlfriend. It was fine – we arrived on Thursday, checked in, and drove to Bruntal for coffee (because hotel coffee is not exactly the most pleasant experience).

Surprisingly, Bruntál surprised me – they have a nice little café on the square called "[Kafe Bybodlo](https://www.instagram.com/kafebybodlo/)" and I can only recommend it. Very nice and cozy atmosphere, nice service, great coffee and very good desserts. 😅 I don't eat sweet things, but I made an exception here. Three times, because we also went there on Friday and Sunday before we left. 😅

I have a small problem with mountains – the mountain air always makes me incredibly tired. So, unlike Týna, which "ran" 18 km to Karlova Studánka and back on Thursday, I snuggled up with a book in my room and just went swimming in the evening. 🙂

On Saturday, we went on a trip, some 14 km from Rejvíz to the Zlatý Chlum lookout tower and back. After arriving at the hotel, Týna and I ended up in the children's pool and relaxed. And splashed each other with water guns. And sending a boat… It was a very nice long weekend.

On Sunday I helped my brother transport the new seats he bought. My scar was calm and I didn't know about it when we carried the seats up to the third floor, so I think I'm okay now.

Other than that, some swimming in the hotel pool and such. Nothing fancy. But good, I'm happy and feeling pretty good. 🙂
