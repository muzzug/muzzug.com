I decided to translate my Weekly Notes into English as well, to make the English section not so empty. I won't translate the previous Weekly Notes, but the new ones will be in English (although I would rather not promise that it will be on the same day as the Czech ones).

Like a lot of stuff I have on the web now, the Weekly Notes format is a rip-off of someone else's — I like the way [JCPRobably](https://social.lol/@jedda) handles their [Week notes](https://notes.jeddacp.com/week-notes-044/). So I'm going to try something similar. 🙂 We'll see how it turns out.
## Working on 
This week has been full of changes.

Sometime last week I came across an article in which [Elena Rossini](https://mastodon.social/@_elena) described how she started hosting various Fediverse platforms (GoToSocial, Pixelfed…) herself. She uses [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org), a modified Debian 12 for simple self-hosting of various services (not only Fediverse). I looked at it, but while I liked it, I did not want to tinker with my up-and-running server, while realizing that its setup isn't quite made for this. I was only paying for a 20 GB disk because I was only running analytics and an RSS reader there so far. And that doesn't take up much space.

The change came on Tuesday when I received an email about running out of credit on my existing VPS. I figured I'd give it a shot, and signed up for [vpsFree.cz](https://vpsfree.cz), where I get a lot more for a little more money. Registration and approval went quickly, and by the afternoon I was installing YunoHost on the new server. 🙂

So far, I only have analytics and an RSS reader, but I'm sure more will appear in time.

Well, the second change was that on Friday after work I decided to “finish” this website. There wasn't really much left to finish, so I just got into it. I tweaked the site so that everything was in both languages, and put it out on Saturday. 

By Sunday, all that was left to do was switch the articles from the original to the new one. Fortunately, that wasn't a problem — the old site ran on Jekyll, the new one runs on Eleventy. Both use Markdown, so it was really just CMD+C, CMD+V, adjusting a few little things (image paths) and checking that everything worked as it should. It works! So from now on, in the new one. 🥳
## Reading

- Disenchantment — as a background for riding an exercise bike
## Listening
- Alestorm — after their performance last week, they're still on my mind. But I'll never tire of pirate metal… 🙂
## Fitness and lifestyle
Týna (my wife) came with the idea that she wanted to watch her food a bit. Well, why not. So we both started writing down what we eat into the "Kalorické tabulky" (Czech food journal with local food). I mean — I probably won't be doing this for very long, but I'm starting to get an idea of where I stand. 👍

🏋️ For the workout, I managed to increase the weights on both trainings I have for a total of three things:
- deadlift -> 80 kg (4x5 reps)
- squat with barbell -> 65 kg (I have a weight increase gradually while decreasing reps — 12-10-8-6, my weights are now 40-55-60-65)
- bench press -> 60 kg (same principle — 10-8-6-3, weights are 40-55-60-60).

🚴 I started riding the exercise bike again. So far, I have it as a filling of my free days when I don't have any other exercise. Tuesdays and Thursdays I'm at the gym, Mondays and Wednesdays I go to the office, so I get plenty of walking (and stairs), so it's just Fridays and weekends that are lazy and with no exercise. So the exercise bike. I always put on an episode of Disenchantment with it and go.

I decided to try to keep my heart rate in the 180 - age  (+- 10) range. In my case, it is 135–155. It should have an impact on cardio and endurance as a whole. So we will see.
