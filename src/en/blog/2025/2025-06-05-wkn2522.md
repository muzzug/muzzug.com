This week has been pretty action packed. Like - action packed! 
Two, to be exact. 😅

Tuesday we had a team beer after work. First the laser game (which I skipped for a workout), and then we went to K1 for steaks and beers. All went well, I was home a little after 10.

On Wednesday, we had another DCC game. Finally, after more than two months, I got to play! I've missed it quite a bit… The guys did give me a short recap of what happened, but there was so much that I don't really remember it properly. Good thing we're playing non-sequential modules, and it doesn't matter.

Otherwise, it looks like we have two more DCC modules to go, and then Vandal wants to try a longer, continuous campaign. We still have to decide which rules to use for the game. I'd quite like to try Pathfinder 2E, but I don't think that's going to happen… 😅

On Friday and Saturday, I (finally) got to ride my scooter a bit more. I did an evening test ride to work and back. It looks like it will be fine. Just a few more times to get a feel for it, and then I'll start riding the scooter to work. I mean - once I figure out where to park. 😁

Otherwise, one minor unpleasant observation - despite having a helmet with pinlock, the glass got quite foggy when I ride after rain. 😔 I'll have to figure out what to do about it.

## Working on
I continued with the other CS50 lessons. I am now buried in the SQL tasks. 

## Reading
I haven't had much time to read, but I'm happily finishing up Hradla, volty, jednočipy (🇨🇿).

## Fitness and lifestyle
I managed both training sessions fine. I mean - I still have problems with the bench press, but otherwise I'm actually at the same load as before the surgery. Yay!

Otherwise, I've talked to my trainer about adjusting my plans, so I'm curious to see what he prepared for me. I've also had an extra workout plan so I can start catching up on missed deadlines.
