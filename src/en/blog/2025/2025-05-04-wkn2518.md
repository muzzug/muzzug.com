This week was a bit sadder.

On Wednesday, I heard from my mom that my grandmother was in the hospital, and things weren't looking good for her…

After some issues between us, which took place around the time of my adolescence, I had a rather not-so-warm relationship with her. Well, not everything can be settled and resolved. Still, I thought of her on my afternoon walk, mentally “wished” her a peaceful passing and hoped that if she had the opportunity to evaluate her life in some way, she would be satisfied with it. Then, on Thursday morning, I got a phone call from my mother that my grandmother had indeed died during the night.

Written like this, it sounds strange, but she was almost 96 years old, and the last couple of years, her health was worse and worse, so I just hope that she really died calm and contented with her life.

Otherwise, I ended my sick leave at the end of April, so I enjoyed my first day at work on Friday. Yay! Remembering passwords and stuff, finding out what's been going on for the last 2 months, going through emails (about 10,500 pieces! 🤯)… And starting Monday, off to the office again. Like –  I have to confess that I'm kind of even looking forward to going there.

I also managed to catch the cleaning lady who takes care of our common areas and got into the garage thanks to her, so I managed to get my scooter out. So now I just need to get riding… 😅 And not kill myself!
