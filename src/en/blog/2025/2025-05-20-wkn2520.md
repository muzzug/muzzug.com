Týna was in Prague for work at the "Svět knihy" festival, so I was home alone with the cat.

All week I was gradually adapting to going back to work. It's really not easy after two months, a lot has changed, and I have a lot to learn.

On Wednesday, we went to Ostrava for my grandmother's funeral. Look, I know funerals are a weird thing (and I've been to about two myself, so I don't have much experience with them), but the lady who moderated it (that's probably not the right word, right?) was really weird. I mean, I didn't need her to experience it with us deeply, but I mean, she might have had some emotion in her voice (other than "boredom")… But whatever.

On Tuesday, I had a second session with a psychologist. We discussed the news (grandma, going back to work) and I took a Rorschach test for the first time in my life. So we'll see, hopefully I passed. I'll find out at my next session.

On Saturday, my friend Ronne came to me from Ostrava. We wanted to discuss (and we did!) our plans for making games and to get a bit more united in our view of what we want to do. We did that (I think), so that's good. The second thing we wanted to do was go to "Kino Art" cinema where was a live play of her gamebook as part of Museum Night. We had time in the afternoon, so we went right to the beginning, checked out (and tried out) the game [Pushmania](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3242870/Pushmania/), and watched the new Indiana Jones gameplay on screen. It was a very enjoyable afternoon.

## Fitness and lifestyle
Going back to the gym was… painful?

After Tuesday's workout (especially after lunges with dumbbells) my thighs ached just when I thought about moving. And Thursday's workout didn't help much either. But I'll get back into it soon! It's just going to take a while, well… 6 weeks was a really long break.
