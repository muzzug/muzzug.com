These Weekly Notes took their time. I'm not going to make excuses - I didn't feel like writing on Sunday and decided to leave it for Monday. I didn't feel like writing on Monday, so I decided to leave it for today. So… 🙂

I had a two doctor's appointments in the week - pulling stitches on Monday and (finally) a psych appointment on Thursday to do something about my anxiety. I mean - the pills I've been on seem to be working, but it doesn't fix the issue, and that's what I need to get to. So far, it's been a bit of a getting to know each other, so we'll see what the next session brings.

Otherwise, as I started working on a game for Godot Wild Jam last week, I stopped this week. Two things are to blame - firstly, my brother came up with some other automations he wanted to do, and they ate up quite a bit of my time. And the main thing was that I wasn't really good at it. 😅 Like - I got a lot of knowledge from that, but when I found out on Wednesday that I'm still at the beginning, and what I'm doing in the end doesn't even entertain me, so I quit. But I learned some stuff, and I guess that's the main thing. 

Otherwise, I watched another part of the CS50 course in my spare time. I still have to finish my homework. 😅

## Intriguing

I came across the article [20 years of Git. Still weird, still wonderful.](https://blog.gitbutler.com/20-years-of-git/). Interesting article, worth reading in itself, but not the main point.

In the article, among other things, the author mentions his book Pro Git. I remembered that I wanted to look at it once, and since I know it was published in [Czech translation by cz.nic](https://knihy.nic.cz/cs/detail/2/)(🇨🇿), I went straight to see if it was still available for download on the cz.nic website. It is.

But that's not all. While browsing the cz.nic web, I couldn't help noticing Martin Malý's new book, [ESP32 prakticky](https://knihy.nic.cz/cs/detail/32/)(🇨🇿). I've seen ESP32 everywhere lately, but I've never paid much attention to it because electrical engineering is beyond me. The last time I almost flunked it was twenty years ago in the high school, and I haven't really been interested in it since. It was all the more surprising when the thought "what about giving it another chance?" flashed through my mind, and I clicked through to Martin's other book, [Hradla, volty, jednočipy](https://knihy.nic.cz/cs/detail/16/)(🇨🇿), about basics of electrical engeneering and microcontrollers, also published by cz.nic. Soon the book was on my iPad and I started reading it in the evening.

For a technical book, it's really simple, clear and funny. So far, I understand it (more or less) without any major problems, but most importantly - it made me think to really try it all out. Especially at the mention of Arduino. I know that Arduino exists, of course, but I never really thought of getting one - making things as such was really beyond me. But now I'm truly starting to be tempted. I spent a couple of hours (😅) watching videos about Arduino, tried to wire a few things virtually in TinkerCad, and it turned out that my own first Arduino is on its way. And with it, both of the books mentioned above - e-books are fine, but for some reason unknown to me, I want to have this one physically. 

I originally (of course) wanted the original Arduino in the form of a Starter Set, but I was a bit put off by the price. After all, it's something I want to try out, and to have a set for almost 3000 CZK just sitting in a drawer in case I wasn't interested didn't appeal to me. Fortunately, there are alternatives, and I reached for a significantly cheaper set from [LaskaKit](https://www.laskakit.cz/en/laskkit-arduino-maxi-starter-kit--rfid/).

So much for what one innocent article about the history of Git can do. 😁 And let's see, maybe articles about making things will start appearing here in addition to the Weekly Notes.
