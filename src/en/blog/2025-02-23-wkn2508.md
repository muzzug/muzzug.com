Well, this week was pretty intense.

Since Monday, I've been going to the doctors — ultrasound, specialist, specialist at the hospital to arrange surgery… All joy. I've been somewhere practically every day. 😒

Seeing the specialist was challenging — the doctor comes in at 7, the seniors who go to him are already there at 6. Once I managed to be there by 6:30 and go for my turn as 3rd — so I would rather not take any chances and went nicely at 6. Only to get there about 15th in a row. 🤦‍♂️ I got to my turn at half past 8, the doctor just looked at the results and sent me straight to the hospital to book an appointment for surgery. Yay!

I tried calling the hospital, but they don't order over the phone, so I had to go in person. As the nurse on the phone told me, they're there from 7, and it's a several hour wait.

Well, I was there at the 7:00 mark on Thursday. In my backpack was a bottle of water, a thermos of coffee and a book. Fully prepared for the many hours wait, I got my order slip, and before I even had time to sit down in the waiting area, they were calling me to register. From there, I was immediately sent to the surgery, and eventually left at 7:30 with an appointment for surgery and a bunch of information about what I still needed to get done.

I still haven't recovered from the fact that I was promised many hours of waiting that I was deprived of… Pffff!

But I have to admit, I've had enough… 😥

## Working on
I've started researching how to upload the game build automatically to itch.io using GitLab jobs. I found info about this on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/10xn3t5/i_just_finished_a_cicd_tutorial_for_godot_4_in/), tried it out, and set it up for my projects. It works beautifully, but…

…during testing, I managed that I drain most of the build minutes that GitLab offers with the free account. And so I've been researching what to do about it. I thought about trying to self-host my GitLab, but when I got the RAM on my server to the max, I figured that wasn't the way to go.

On the other hand, — there is an option to have GitLab Runner, which can run on my server, which will be fine for my needs. So I tried it, and it works!

Otherwise, I continue to explore what all YunoHost offers and what I could host myself. I have a feeling that the basic server won't be enough for me for a while with that. 😅

## Learning
I started going (again) through the Godot courses that I have purchased. I haven't touched Godot for a while, and it's time to brush up on my knowledge and learn something new.

## Reading
Just like last week:
- Annie Zimmerman: Your Pocket Therapist (Czech edition)
- Jesse Schell: The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses (3rd Edition)

## Listening
The beginning of the week belonged (still) to Alestorm. On Tuesday, Little Big started playing in my head right after I woke up, so I put it on. And since Wednesday, I've been listening to Heilung over and over again.

So that's pirate metal, rave/techno/hard bass and healing neofolk. Interesting combination. 🙂

## Fitness and lifestyle
New progress on squats with barbell in the gym — got up to 6x70, so now I'm doing 40-50-60-70

As for the treadmill, I got two rides in this week:
- 00:20:03, 8.71 km, 26.1 km/h, 142 bpm average.
- 00:20:03, 9.10 km, 27.2 km/h, 146 bpm average

Somehow, I'm starting to slow down.😒

## What caught my eye
People are extremely curious. When I mentioned I was having surgery, they automatically asked what exactly. They don't realize that if I'm going to tell them, I will tell it straight out and not wait for them to ask…
