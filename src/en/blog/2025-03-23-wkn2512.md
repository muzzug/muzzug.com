Fourth week of sick leave… It's going by fast.

I had an appointment with the doctor on Monday, and we discussed the anxiety that's started showing up. We agreed that rest alone won't help — as the “normal” worries start to fall away, buried things started to show. I have an appointment with a psychologist, but it won't be until mid-May (and it's still “priority” through the clinic 😅).  So the doctor gave me some pills to repair the hormone levels in my brain.  
Well, you can celebrate St. Patrick with antidepressants too, right? ☘️

The next medical exam before surgery (on Friday) went great, and the surgery will be easier. Yay!

Otherwise, I'm continuing with my routine, nothing new happening.

Tina's cousin visiting us for the weekend, so it was in the name of socializing.

## Working on

- I started making the first prototype of the 3D game. I'm enjoying it. I'm running into wholly different problems than when I tried 2D, but I'm having more fun. 
- I'm trying to do automations to learn a bit more.<br><br>On Wednesday, I went through the official [n8n courses](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/) and on Thursday I did an automation for moving the links that I saved on Mastodon to read it later application. It takes a booked post, gets the links out of it, and saves them to Wallabag.<br><br>I was pleased about that. Until it uploaded the 1200 links that I'd saved in the last two years I've been on Mastodon to Wallabag. Who's supposed to read that?! 😅
- I tried to delve more into the ins and outs of self-hosting, but I ran into some minor issues with not being able to get the application containers I wanted to run through Podman. 😔 I mean - the containers started, but I couldn't set them to start automatically by systemd. And regardless of what I did, it just wouldn't work. None of the tutorials I found worked. So I don't know, well, I'll give it another shot.

## Reading

- Terry Pratchett: The Light Fantastic
- Jesse Schell: The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses (3rd Edition)

## Listening

- audiobook “Take a Deep Breath” by Elissa Epel
- podcasts of Level magazine (CZ) 

## Playing

- Badur's Gate: Enchanted Edition

## Watching

- [Star Wars: The Bad Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Bad_Batch)

## Fitness and lifestyle

- Workouts at the gym are going fine. I'm still struggling a bit with the bench press (with the 60 kg), but otherwise good. We won't be changing my training plan until the end of March, and I'll have a new one ready after the surgery. I am curious.

I managed 2 other activities this week:
- leisurely walk while listening to an audiobook - 7.28 km, 01:42:48, 4.2 km/h pace.
- exercise bike ride - 7.69 km, 00:20:06, pace 23.0 km/h, average 135 beats 

## What caught my eye

- Video on [targeted fat burning ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XRKDJdG_rA) - the general approach is that you can't target a specific place to burn fat when exercising. Well, the new studies supposedly show that it can. It looks interesting, and I'll definitely try to use it. 🙂
