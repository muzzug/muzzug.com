Yesterday I was lazy, so I'm writing the Weekly Notes today.

My second week of sick leave is over. It's a bit overwhelming, but I'm trying to keep some sort of order and not just blow it off.

During the week, I got a call from my brother asking if I was eager to learn about automation and creating different scenarios. I looked into it, and it looks pretty interesting and there are many things you can do with it! I'll definitely look into it a bit more.

Otherwise, I'm relaxing, going for walks and stuff. Nothing too strenuous. 

## Na čem dělám

On Monday, [Godot 4.4 ](https://godotengine.org/releases/4.4/) came out with a bunch of new stuff for 3D games, and I was starting to get a little curious about whether I should check it out. I'm a bit stuck when it comes to my own 2D projects, and I'm actually struggling a bit. So I figured I'd try to check out a couple of courses on 3D I've bought, and see. And well — 3D is awesome! I'm very excited about it (although the courses are made for the older version — 4.1, so sometimes I have to search a lot, it's changed a lot in those 3 versions). I'll see what I can come up with.

Other than that, I've been trying to learn a bit about self-hosting. Not that YunoHost doesn't suit me, but it doesn't have everything I come across that I want to try, so I've been playing around with playground VPS. Well, so far, I'm not good at it, and I'm more in the phase of perpetual reinstalls after I do something wrong. 
But it can be done, I believe in it!

## Čtu

- Terry Pratchett: The Light Fantastic
- Jesse Schell: The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses (3rd Edition)

## Poslouchám

- Nothing specific, but for some reason I was in the mood for British punk rock after workout on Tuesday, so a random playlist on Spotify solved that.
- Otherwise, I listened to a few podcasts while walking.

## Fitness a životní styl

I still go on health walks. It's (more or less) the same route every time, but it's just right, I've got it down, and I find that I actually slow down my whole pace a bit. I've even started walking back, not taking the tram. And on Saturday I extended it considerably when I was looking for a flower for Tina for International Women's Day. 😅

I'm keeping my gym workouts on schedule so far. Except that I didn't do bench-press on Thursday, but otherwise I'm fine.
