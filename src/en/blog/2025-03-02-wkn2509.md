This week was full of relaxation.

On Monday, I ended up at the doctor's office — I needed to settle the details of the pre-op appointment and such. Well, and we talked a bit about how I was feeling, what was wrong with me… It turns out that  I'm on sick leave due to burnout/exhaustion or something.

Honestly, I'm not surprised. I've been feeling it for a while now, and the fact that I can rest at ease is just welcome. Especially in combination with preparing for surgery (and then recovering from surgery).

So I've been home since Monday and ~~bored~~~ resting. I'm reading, playing the ukulele… And doing online courses and creating my own stuff. Anything I can do to unwind.

I also used the time off to do my tax return. Quite early this year. 😅

## Working on
I've started a complete overhaul of my RPG game made in Godot. A friend has joined me to take care of the story line (something I've been fumbling in quite a bit). She's still working on some of her project, but at least we can use the time to revise what to do and what not to do.

I've also dabbled a bit in self-hosting. I have to admit that being able to install different services with a few clicks is a bit addictive. 😅 For someone who started with RSS and web analytics, my list of installed apps has grown quite a bit. Currently I have:

- Calibre web (e-book management)
- FreshRSS (RSS reader)
- Huginn (alternative to IFTTT, but we're not quite friends yet)
- Paperless-ngx (online document archive)
- Syncthing (synchronization between PCs)
- Umami (web analytics)
- Uptime Kuma (monitoring everything)
- Wallabag (read-it-later application, replacement for the cancelled Omniwore)


Well, it's not a little. I admit that if I tried to run it all myself (like docker containers), I would probably have one thing. 😅 But I'll definitely try it sometime, the possibilities of self-hosting are starting to interest me more and more, and it probably wouldn't be bad to understand it a bit. Not just click. 

## Writing
One short summary of how to [set notifications from Uptime Kuma to Matrix](how-to-set-up-notifications-from-uptime-kuma-to-matrix).
## Reading
- Terry Pratchett: The Colour of Magic
- Jesse Schell: The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses (3rd Edition)

I've finished reading "Your Pocket Therapist" by Annie Zimmerman, and I have so much to think about. Just reading it and thinking about the issues the author discusses gave me a few moments where my eyes got a little wet. So, I've got something to work on. 🙃 I recommend the book to absolutely anyone who is interested in how to improve their mental health a bit. 👍

## Listening
Actually, it was just Heilung this week. I mixed in Hagalaz Runedance a few times, but Heilung led the way this week. 

## Fitness and lifestyle
As I mentioned at the beginning, I'm on sick leave right now. My doctor and I agreed that I would go out in the afternoon — she approved the gym and that I would go for walks. So I'm going for walks.

I have my favorite route, about 4 km to Obřany. So far, I'm taking the tram back, but it looks like the weather will be nicer, so I'll take it hobbit style — there and back again.

I've done 4 walks so far:
- 3.85 km, 00:40:24, pace 5.7 km/h.
- 3.97 km, 00:46:00, pace 5.2 km/h.
- 3.93 km, 00:43:42, pace 5.4 km/h
- 3.93 km, 00:45:24, pace 5.2 km/h

Yeah, it's kind of… monotonous? 😅 But I like the route, it's around the river, through the park and so… It's just a really peaceful and pleasant walk.
