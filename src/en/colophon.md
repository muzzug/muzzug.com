This site is powered by the static page generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev).  
It is based on the template [eleventy-i18n](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-i18n). created by [Lene Saile](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@lene@front-end.social).  
The look itself was taken from the [jekyl-klise](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) template for Jekyll (which IÂ used before).

The site is hosted at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), I have the source code on [Github](https://github.com/muzzug/muzzug.com).
