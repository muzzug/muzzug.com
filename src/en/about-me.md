Hi. 👋 I am Muzzug and this is my piece of the Internet.

I work as production support specialist at a bank. 👨‍💻 I keep all the banking applications working properly. And I manage the PSD2 API stuff. And since 2024, I'm taking care of the new payment solution we came up with.

>> This page is full of common informations about me.
>> If you are interested in things which I do not, look at [Now](now.html) page.

## Hobbies and interests
Games and game design I enjoy old games. My favorite is definitely Ultima Online. I started it when I was eleven, and I go back to it irregularly every year. 🙂

Other than that, though, I enjoy playing Diablo II, Baldur's Gate, or even The Witcher. Currently, the third one.

I spend my evenings, weekends, and all sorts of other spare time by exploring game design and development. And I want to make my own games.

## Tabletop RPG
I'm a fan of tabletop RPGs. My most favorite is probably the old D&D retroclone [Old-School Essentials](https://necroticgnome.com/pages/about-old-school-essentials), which I helped translate.

## Ukulele
I've been trying to learn to play the ukulele for a few years now.
I currently have two — one electroacoustic and one electric. Yes, electric. It's small, has four strings, and sounds like an electric guitar. But it's a ukulele. 😁

## Where to find me
I am currently active on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@muzzug).  
And if you'd like, you can send me an [e-mail](mailto:{{meta.email}}).
